{"name":"Cerv","tagline":"Cerv is a cross-platform desktop SSL/TLS checker written in Java.","body":"### Welcome to Cerv.\r\nI wrote this program as I feel sometimes websites can be a letdown.  They can often go down leaving you stranded.  I figured a desktop application would be a perfect substitute for this problem, its much faster also.  As long as you have any form of PC and an internet connection which are the basic requirements of the program, it will work.\r\nP.s you need Java 8+ also.\r\n\r\n### About me.\r\nI'm new to Java, I'm not an expert programmer in any stretch of the imagination, but I enjoy trying to figure out problems as best I can, whether it's asking for help on programming websites (Stackoverflow, etc), irc, google searches and my last resort a family friend (who I don't like bothering).\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nIf you need to get into contact with me, you can do so via Skype (crashez911).\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nI'm currently the only contributor, and I am always looking for more help.  Feel free to contact me if you'd like to help out.  Also I know the source is brutal, but I'm still learning as I go.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
